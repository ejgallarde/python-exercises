Exercise 1 - Introduction to Python

 Questions:
    1. Which version of Python is being used?
    A: In the command line, type python (Windows) or python -v (Linux)

    2. Using an editor, create a new script called exl.py. Within this script, create two variables,
    one containing your first name and another containing your last name. Display them using
    print with a space between each one.

    Run the script:
        a) From a command-line
        b) From PyCharm

    3. We have a simple module for displaying a playing card, called showcard. It has
    a function called display_file which takes one parameter: the name of a gif file.
    The playing card filenames are of the following format:

        BMPn.GIF

    Where n is a number between 1and 52, indicating the ordinal number of the
    card in the pack. Note that on Linux this is case sensitive,

    Write a Python program called pickacard.py which uses this module to display
    a single card. Prompt the user for a number, as follows:

        number = input("Pick a card (1-52): ")

    Then, construct a filename from number, and then display the card by passing
    the filename to showcard.display_file as a parameter.

    Don't worry about out-of-range numbers for the time being.

If time allows...

    4. The card display currently times out after five seconds. You may wish to adjust
    this by calling showcard.set_timeout(number_of_seconds).
